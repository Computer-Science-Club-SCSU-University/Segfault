## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some project-specific conventions:

```python
# Use type hints
async def fetch_jobs(query: str, limit: int = 25) -> List[Job]:
    pass

# Use descriptive variable names
announcement_channel_id = int(os.getenv("ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID"))

# Use docstrings for public functions
async def publish_announcement(message_id: int) -> PublishResult:
    """
    Publish a Discord message to the website.
    
    Args:
        message_id: The Discord message ID to publish
        
    Returns:
        PublishResult containing success status and details
        
    Raises:
        ChannelNotFoundError: If the message channel is invalid
        PermissionError: If user lacks publish permissions
    """
```

### Coding Standards

#### Discord.py Best Practices
```python
# Use application commands (slash commands)
@app_commands.command(name="publish", description="Publish announcement to website")
async def publish(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, message_id: str = None):
    pass

# Always defer for operations > 3 seconds
await interaction.response.defer(ephemeral=True)

# Use ephemeral responses for feedback
await interaction.followup.send("‚úÖ Published successfully!", ephemeral=True)

# Handle errors gracefully
try:
    result = await self.api_call()
except APIError as e:
    await interaction.followup.send(f"‚ùå Error: {e.message}", ephemeral=True)
```

#### Async/Await Patterns
```python
# Use async context managers
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(url, json=data)

# Batch async operations when possible
tasks = [fetch_job(job_id) for job_id in job_ids]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

#### Error Handling
```python
# Create custom exceptions
class SegFaultError(Exception):
    """Base exception for SegFault bot errors."""
    pass

class PublishError(SegFaultError):
    """Error occurred during announcement publishing."""
    pass

# Log errors with context
logger.error(
    "Failed to publish announcement",
    extra={
        "message_id": message_id,
        "user_id": interaction.user.id,
        "error": str(e)
    }
)
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from announcements.cog import AnnouncementsCog

class TestAnnouncementsCog:
    @pytest.fixture
    async def cog(self):
        bot = AsyncMock()
        return AnnouncementsCog(bot)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_publish_success(self, cog):
        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_publish_permission_denied(self, cog):
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All public methods must have tests
- **Integration Tests**: API interactions should be mocked
- **Error Cases**: Test error handling and edge cases
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% code coverage required

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation
```python
class JobsCog(commands.Cog):
    """
    Discord cog for managing job opportunity postings.
    
    This cog integrates with the Simplify API to fetch job postings
    and automatically posts them to designated Discord channels.
    """
    
    async def fetch_jobs(self, query: str = None) -> List[Job]:
        """
        Fetch job postings from Simplify API.
        
        Args:
            query: Optional search query to filter jobs
            
        Returns:
            List of Job objects matching the criteria
            
        Raises:
            SimplifyAPIError: If the API request fails
            RateLimitError: If rate limit is exceeded
        """
```

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(jobs): add remote-only job filtering
fix(announcements): handle missing message permissions
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(resume): add unit tests for file validation
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_announcements.py

# Run tests with verbose output
python -m pytest -v
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **API Tests**: Test external API integrations (mocked)
4. **Discord Tests**: Test Discord interaction handling

### Writing Good Tests
```python
# Test naming convention
def test_publish_announcement_success():
    """Test successful announcement publishing."""
    pass

def test_publish_announcement_invalid_permissions():
    """Test publishing fails with insufficient permissions."""
    pass

# Use descriptive assertions
assert result.success is True
assert result.published_url == expected_url
assert len(result.errors) == 0

# Mock external dependencies
@patch('announcements.cog.httpx.AsyncClient')
async def test_api_integration(mock_client):
    mock_client.return_value.__aenter__.return_value.post.return_value.status_code = 201
    # Test implementation
```
